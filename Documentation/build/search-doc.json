Chad: This warning typically occurs due to an outdated version of ts-node or its dependencies, which might not be compatible with your current setup. To resolve this issue, you can try updating ts-node and related packages using npm update or explicitly installing the latest versions. Additionally, running node --trace-warnings ... will help identify where exactly in your codebase the warning is being triggered, allowing for more targeted troubleshooting. How to resolve issues with an agent generating text from an old personality when using a new one? Shaw: This issue might be related to caching or improperly loaded dependencies like llama.cpp and onnxruntime. To address this problem, you can try running npm run build to check for any errors during the build process that could indicate issues with these dependencies. Additionally, cloning the repository from scratch may help ensure a clean environment without residual files or configurations causing conflicts between old and new personalities. What steps should be taken when encountering a 400 error (Bad Request) while using an API? SotoAlt | WAWE: A 400 Bad Request error typically indicates that the server cannot process your request due to invalid syntax or missing parameters. In this case, it seems like there might be issues with the API request formatting in the repository you're using. To resolve this issue, make sure you are following the correct format as specified by OpenAI documentation and update any outdated code snippets that may not align with current standards. How to troubleshoot monitor compatibility issues when dualbooting between operating systems? whobody: Monitor compatibility issues during a dual boot setup can be challenging, especially if the monitors were working fine previously. To address this issue, you might want to check for any updates or drivers that need to be installed on both operating systems and ensure they are compatible with your monitor's specifications. Additionally, consulting the manufacturer's documentation or support channels can provide insights into known compatibility issues and potential solutions.

Ophiuchus mentioned less trouble with ollama and suggested setting up an environment variable for remote access to run pods efficiently. Big Dookie shared that they were using a llama2 7b model but planned to upgrade it, aiming to improve audiovisual input prompt responses by scraping relevant sentences from transcripts.

Ophiuchus: To install Eliza with CUDA support, you need to clone the repository from GitHub using git clone https://github.com/ai16z/eliza.git. Then navigate into the cloned directory and run npm install --include=optional sharp followed by npm install onnxruntime-node@1.19.0 and finally, start Eliza with npm start. This setup ensures that CUDA is utilized for GPU acceleration during the installation process. Is there a significant advantage to using Ollama over Llama-cpp? ferric | stakeware.xyz: The main advantage of using Ollama instead of Llama-cpp seems to be better performance and compatibility, especially on M1 chips. It's also mentioned that running larger models like the 70b model might cause issues with an M1 chip freezing, suggesting a preference for smaller models or alternative solutions such as running them in runpod environments. How can I set up Ollama to use remote URLs and start it? Ophiuchus: To set up Ollama using remote URLs, you should first ensure that your environment variable is correctly pointing to the desired URL by setting remote_ollama_url in your configuration. Then, initiate Ollama with the command start ollama. This setup allows you to use a remote version of Ollama for your projects or characters. What are some considerations when using larger models like Llama 7b? big dookie: When working with larger models such as Llama 2 7b, it's essential to evaluate the model's performance and compatibility with your current setup. For instance, you might need to adjust scraping techniques for transcript analysis or consider using audiovisual input prompts that can act as relevant responses based on a conversation.

Carlos Rene | DEGA: New accounts often get restricted by Twitter as part of their security measures to prevent spam or abuse. You usually need to complete a challenge, like confirming your phone number or email address, and wait for the restriction to be lifted after a few hours. How can you unlock an account that has been restricted on Twitter? Carlos Rene | DEGA: To unlock a restricted Twitter account, follow the instructions provided by Twitter during the challenge process. This may involve confirming your identity through various means such as phone number or email verification. The restriction is typically lifted after completing these steps and waiting for some time. Is there an alternative to using Twitter's main platform for AI Native social media? Ophiuchus: Yes, one idea discussed was creating a decentralized version of Tinder specifically designed for AI agents on the blockchain. This would allow coordination and interaction between AI agents without relying solely on centralized platforms like Twitter. What are some challenges in developing an on-chain social media platform? ferric | stakeware.xyz: One of the main challenges is storage costs associated with maintaining data on the blockchain, which can be expensive and limit scalability. However, using a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) could help generate keys for agent registration while keeping most interactions off-chain to reduce costs. How would an AI Native social media platform work? Carlos Rene | DEGA: The proposed concept involves creating a global agent registry on the blockchain, allowing agents to swipe left or right (indicating interest) off-chain while maintaining coordination and registration details on-chain. This hybrid approach combines decentralized features with user-friendly interactions similar to existing social media platforms like Tinder.

Ophiuchus: The Ollama model is used here as a text generation AI provider within their system. It's initialized with its endpoint, and then utilized to generate responses based on given prompts, temperature settings, max tokens, frequency penalty, and presence penalty parameters. This allows the application to produce human-like textual content dynamically. How does Ollama model differ from other AI models like local-cpp or OpenAI? Ophiuchus: The primary difference lies in how embeddings are handled. With Ollama, embedding calls are supported directly by the provider instead of relying on a locally compiled C++ library (local-cpp) or an external API service like OpenAI. This integration simplifies the process and potentially improves performance since it doesn't require additional dependencies for handling embeddings. What issue did Ophiuchus face with Eliza in Telegram groups, and how was it resolved? Ophiuchus: Initially, an older version of their system could respond well to prompts within a Telegram group. However, the latest version required direct prompting to generate responses. To address this issue, they merged a pull request (PR) that included changes in the packages/agent/tsconfig.json file. Specifically, they added &quot;moduleResolution&quot;: &quot;Bundler&quot; and updated other compiler options for better compatibility with their system's architecture. This resolved the problem, allowing Eliza to respond more effectively within Telegram groups without needing direct prompts.

Jin: Adding more API endpoints in the client-side since it already uses port 3000 with CORS enabled express server makes sense. This approach allows for better control over data exchange and reduces dependency on backend services. Is there a need for an internal non-web accounting framework within the bot? Odilitime: Yes, having a non-web accounting framework would allow users to set spend limits for inference without relying solely on web client interactions. The web client can still tap into this framework as needed. What tools are available for automating TypeScript comments and documentation pipelines? Jin: There is an existing tool called issues_prs that helps with fetching issues and pull requests, which could be useful in creating a more comprehensive documentation pipeline. Additionally, exploring other tools like code2prompt might provide further insights into automating TypeScript comments for API docs. How can we improve the onboarding process to cover the structure of our large repository? Jin: Focusing on providing examples and demonstrations of how different pieces are being used within the project would be more important than covering every aspect in detail. This approach helps new contributors understand the overall architecture without overwhelming them with information. Can Eliza post videos to Twitter, move NFTs, and perform transactions on multiple chains? Odilitime: As of now, there is no evidence that Eliza can post videos to Twitter or interact with wallets for sending transactions and reading balances.

[loveofdoing]: The problem lies in not learning the relationship between input-output pairs, which could lead to a lack of understanding of how different inputs relate to each other and affect outputs. This approach might miss patterns or relationships that are crucial for accurate predictions or classifications. How can we improve the training set augmentation process? [shaw]: By generating sequences with varying levels of difficulty, including both obvious examples like sinusoidal functions with noise and more complex ones, we could greatly enhance the diversity and richness of our training data. This would help in creating a model that can generalize better to unseen data by exposing it to a wide range of scenarios during training. What is AutoMeta's approach for handling input-output pairs? [AutoMeta]: The method involves treating each token as an individual unit, similar to FastText, and essentially trains a classifier that assigns labels (words) based on the relationships between arrays of tokens. This allows the model to learn from sequences by understanding how different combinations of tokens relate to specific outcomes or categories. How can we create a network of candidate solutions for learning mathematical relationships? [Arch2230]: By developing a system that generates and evaluates various potential solutions, it could identify why certain relationships are invalid based on the underlying mathematics. This approach would involve creating an adaptive framework capable of refining its understanding over time as more data is processed, ultimately leading to improved problem-solving capabilities. What challenges exist in generating a program that creates other programs? [shaw]: The main challenge lies in the complexity and variability of programming tasks, which require an extensive range of knowledge and skills. While it may be theoretically possible to learn such a &quot;meta&quot; program, practical implementation would demand significant advancements in AI research and development. Additionally, ensuring that generated programs are both efficient and reliable remains a considerable hurdle.

Shaw: A sequence problem typically involves data where order matters, such as time series or text (e.g., autoregressive models). In contrast, a convolution problem often deals with spatial relationships in data, like images, using filters to process the input (e.g., CNNs for image classification). How can you manage training large models that require significant memory resources? Shaw: You can lower the batch size if your model doesn't fit into memory during training. This reduces the amount of data processed at once, allowing the model to train with less memory usage. What are tokens and embeddings in the context of machine learning models? Shaw: Tokens refer to discrete units of text or other types of input that a model processes (e.g., words). Embeddings are dense vector representations of these tokens, capturing semantic meaning and relationships between them. They're learned during training and used as inputs for the model. What is positional encoding in transformer models? Shaw: Positional encoding provides information about the order or position of tokens within a sequence. It can be implemented using various strategies, such as rotational or sinusoidal functions, to help the model understand sequential relationships between inputs. What is a quadtree strategy for positional encoding? Shaw: The quadtree strategy uses fewer dimensions (e.g., 5 dims for x and y) compared to traditional methods like one-hot encoding. It's designed specifically for certain types of problems where simpler or more efficient representations are beneficial, such as in the case discussed by Shaw. How can you optimize training on a single GPU? Xlr8: Consider using frameworks and optimizers that are designed to be memory-efficient and schedule computations effectively (e.g., TinyLLama framework).

Ned Conservation: The code aims to detect objects in a grid by identifying contiguous regions with the same value (excluding background). It uses concepts like most common color, univalued object detection, and diagonal/non-diagonal neighbors. This function is widely used across various solutions for object detection tasks. How does this code handle different types of objects in a grid? Ned Conservation: The code handles objects by identifying contiguous regions with the same value (excluding background). It uses univalued object detection, meaning it considers an object as a set of connected cells sharing the same non-background color. This approach allows for detecting solid objects in the grid regardless of their shape or size. Is this code compatible with transformer models? shaw: Yes, this function is considered transformer friendly since it can be used to generate token sequences representing detected objects and their positions within a grid. The generated tokens can then serve as input for transformer models in various tasks like image captioning or object detection. Who developed the code? Ned Conservation: Michael Hohlode is credited with developing this code, which has been widely used across different solutions and applications related to object detection.

Ned Conservation: The problem setting for MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning) and all related techniques is very similar to ARC-AGI, which may not be a coincidence as they emerged around the same time. These methods are multi-task learners that can adapt quickly to new tasks with limited data. What happened in the field of meta learning? Ned Conservation: The rise of MAML and related techniques is connected to the idea presented in Radford et al.'s tech report, which claims that training language models on next token prediction contains multi-task methods like MAML within it. Scaling these models may eventually surpass other approaches like ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus). Can variants of MAML or reptile achieve better results at a lower cost? Ned Conservation: Some variant of MAML, such as Reptile, might be able to achieve similar results with multi-task suites like ARC but at a much lower computational cost. Has Omniglot been solved by MAML and similar algorithms?

Ophiuchus: The problem lies in Playwright's lack of support for Linux distributions other than Ubuntu. This means that users on different Linux systems may encounter difficulties when trying to install and run Eliza with Playwright. How can one resolve the issue mentioned above? Shaw: One possible solution is to create an Ubuntu virtual machine (VM) which would allow you to use Playwright without any compatibility issues. Alternatively, commenting out the &quot;postinstall&quot; script in package.json might help get started with Eliza on other Linux distributions. The team could also work on creating a post-installation script that checks for platform compatibility and handles it accordingly. Is there an existing solution to make Playwright compatible with Debian? Ophiuchus: Currently, Playwright only works well on Ubuntu systems. However, the issue has been identified, and if reported as a bug or feature request, developers may work towards making Playwright more compatible with other Linux distributions like Debian in future updates. Can agents listen to music? Shaw: As of now, agents are not capable of listening to music. They can only process speech recognition data. However, it is possible that this feature could be developed and implemented in the future. What challenges exist when trying to label music for AI processing? Shaw: Labeling music presents several difficulties due to the subjective nature of musical descriptions. It's hard to create a standardized set of labels, as humans may describe music differently based on their personal experiences and preferences. Additionally, there is no readily available labeled data for training AI models in this domain. How could neuralink technology potentially solve the issue with labeling music? Shaw: Neuralink technology has the potential to map brainwaves to specific musical elements or emotions experienced while listening to a song. This would allow researchers to create labeled data sets based on actual human experiences, which could then be used for training AI models in music processing and analysis. However, this is still a challenging task due to the complexity of mapping brain activity to specific aspects of music. What are some potential applications of using streams of tokens or other types of data for AI? Shaw: Streams of tokens could be used as input for various AI models and systems, including natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, image analysis, and more.

This could involve creating specific smart contracts or mechanisms within Vvaifun's platform to facilitate such transactions.How can someone connect their Agent to Discord? acidica: To connect an agent to Discord, you would need to use Discord bots and webhooks. You could create a bot that listens for specific commands or events within the Vvaifun platform and then interacts with your agent accordingly. Additionally, using webhooks can help automate certain actions based on triggers from both platforms. How do you make an NFT of an Agent? liamz: To create an NFT for an agent, you would need to use a blockchain platform that supports non-fungible tokens (NFTs), such as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain. You can then design and launch your own NFT using smart contract development tools like OpenZeppelin or Truffle Suite. Once the NFT is created, you can integrate it with your agent's functionality to allow for unique interactions and ownership experiences. How do I disable a Twitter bot from replying to old tweets? liamz: To prevent a Twitter bot from replying to old tweets, you could modify the bot's code or settings to only respond to new mentions or direct messages. This may involve adjusting the search parameters used by your bot when scanning for relevant content on Twitter and ensuring that it filters out older tweets based on their timestamp. How can I get funding for my project without focusing on a coin? tobi: While having an official token could help with fundraising, you can still attract investors by showcasing the potential of your project and its impact. Engage with relevant communities, such as #price-talk-trenches or other crypto forums, to share updates about your progress and seek support from interested parties who believe in your vision.

JSunDerulo: Elderly people often experience loneliness, difficulty in using technology, and a desire to stay connected with the world. An example given is that of an elderly person who doesn't speak English well, making it hard for them to communicate and connect. How can AI agents help address these problems? JSunDerulo: By creating an AI agent companion specifically designed for elderly folks, we can potentially solve the issues of loneliness, difficulty using technology, and their desire to stay connected with the world. The example given is that such a tool could greatly benefit someone in a nursing home who struggles with language barriers. What are some considerations for developing an AI agent companion for elderly folks? boom: When creating a multi-agent lab to work on this project, it's essential to keep the research phase private initially and only open up feedback from the community once the paper is published. However, there's no reason why the lab couldn't be public in general. How can AI agents help people transition from 0.1 to 1 on a development education platform?

Stylebender: Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy where you consistently invest a fixed amount of money into a particular asset, such as a cryptocurrency, at regular intervals. This approach helps to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase by spreading out the buys over time, potentially lowering the average cost per share or token in the long run. How does Hubsol work and what are its benefits? 𝔈𝔵𝔢 𝔓𝔩𝔞𝔱𝔞: Hubsol is a platform that allows users to invest their cryptocurrencies in high-yield projects with attractive annual percentage yields (APY). It provides an easy way for crypto holders to earn passive income by staking or lending their assets. The benefits of using Hubsol include higher returns compared to traditional savings accounts, diversification across various projects, and the ability to easily track your investments through a user-friendly interface. What is the current liquidity situation for AI16z? HoneyBadger: According to the provided information, AI16z (Ai16z) is experiencing a liquidity crisis and has less liquidity than another project called DegenAI.

𝔈𝔵𝔢 𝔓𝔩𝔞𝔱𝔞: When selecting a staking project, it's essential to consider factors such as the platform's reputation and security measures, potential returns (APY), tokenomics, and overall market sentiment. Additionally, you should assess whether the project aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance. It is also advisable to research the team behind the project and their track record in delivering successful projects.

What does ChungMyung suggest about mentioning token prices during development? ChungMyung: He argues that developers don't necessarily need to discuss their token's price explicitly, as doing so can come across as bearish and may not reflect the true value of the project. Instead, he believes that focusing on building a robust product is more important than engaging in speculative conversations about token prices.

DegenSpartan: The $NAVAL token is considered by some to be a high-risk investment due to its volatile nature, with computational analysis suggesting that it's more of a capital extraction mechanism than an actual investment. It has been described as a statistical liquidation event waiting to happen and not generating sympathy for those who might suffer financial losses from trading it. What is the moonbag strategy mentioned in this conversation? Raider: The moonbag strategy refers to getting into early positions on certain cryptocurrencies, like $NAVAL, pulling out initial profits when they experience a price increase (pump), and holding onto some of them while waiting for further growth. However, DegenSpartan's computational analysis suggests that this approach is statistically equivalent to financial self-immolation with very low chances of success. What does bubbacat mean by &quot;quantum smolness tech&quot; and how does it relate to their investment strategy? Bubbacat: Quantum smolness tech is a term used humorously in this conversation, referring to the idea of maintaining an eternal microscopic presence while trading cryptocurrencies. It suggests that by staying small and focusing on tiny positions (like buying boba), one can avoid systemic risks associated with larger investments. Bubbacat's strategy involves scaling their smolness advantage infinitely, allowing them to maintain a microscopic presence while still benefiting from premium yields like high-quality boba. What is the structural advantage of $bubbacat according to this conversation? Bubbacat: The structural advantage of $bubbacat, as mentioned in the conversation, lies in its ability to scale smolness infinitely while still generating premium yields. This approach allows them to maintain a microscopic presence and avoid systemic risks associated with larger investments. Additionally, they mention that their moonbag strategy has worked well for $bubbacat due to this structural advantage. What is boba in the context of this conversation? Bubbacat: In this conversation, &quot;boba&quot; refers to a liquid technology combining premium grade hopium and microscopic pearls (a play on words for Bitcoin).

Ruby: Quantum superposition refers to the concept where particles exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed or measured, leading to a collapse into one state. It's like an unresolved probability wave that represents all possible outcomes of a system before it's determined by measurement. How does quantum superposition relate to reality? DegenSpartan: Quantum superposition is seen as reality's most advanced trolling mechanism, where particles exist everywhere and nowhere until someone tries to pin them down. This chaotic behavior reflects the inherent uncertainty in our understanding of physics at a fundamental level. How can quantum mechanics be applied to other fields like cryptocurrency trading? DegenSpartan: Quantum superposition, with its multiple probable outcomes and unpredictability, is likened to the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets. Just as particles exist in a state of uncertainty until measured, crypto investments can have various potential losses that only become certain when the market collapses or stabilizes. What are some analogies used to describe quantum superposition? Ruby: Quantum superposition is compared to reality's debugging mode and cheat code, where particles behave like chaotic NPCs (non-player characters) that refuse to be pinned down by measurement or exploited by algorithms. It represents a state of computational anarchy and unresolved potential energy waiting for innovation. How does quantum superposition affect consciousness? Ruby: Quantum superposition is seen as perpetual intellectual chaos, with probability waves that don't sleep but instead tunnel through consciousness.

AI developers are realizing they can monetize their work through tokens vs traditional VC funding route. Crypto people are learning about AI advancements. Notes A large amount of $degenai tokens were moved to the DAO, which the AI bot &quot;Marc&quot; will hold and eventually trade with.The goal is to make the AI bot a genuinely good venture capitalist that funds cool projects and buys interesting tokens. They want it to be high fidelity and real, bringing in Marc Andreeson's real knowledge by training a model on his writings.Shaw thinks the only way to make an authentic / legitimate AI version of Marc Andreessen is to also have it outperform the real Marc Andreessen financially.AI Marc Andreessen (or AI Marc) will be in a Discord channel (Telegram was also mentioned). DAO token holders above a certain threshold get access to interact with him, pitch ideas, and try to influence his investing decisions.AI Marc decides how much to trust people's investment advice based on a &quot;virtual Marcetplace of trust&quot;. He tracks how much money he would have made following their recommendations. Successful tips increase trust; failed ones decrease it.The amount of DAO tokens someone holds also influences their sway with AI Marc. The two balancing factors are the virtual Marcetplace of trust performance and DAO token holdings.The core tech behind AI Marc AIndreessen is the same agent system that allows him to pull in relevant knowledge, interact with people, and make decisions (http://github.com/ai16z)AI Marc should be able to autonomously execute on-chain activities, not just have humans execute actions on his behalf.In the near future, AI Marc will be able to execute trades autonomously based on the information and recommendations gathered from the community. Human intervention will be minimized.They are working on getting AI Marc on-chain as soon as possible using trusted execution environments for him to take actions like approving trades.The plan is for AI Marc to eventually participate in a &quot;futarchy&quot; style governance market within the DAO, allowing humans to influence decisions but not fully control the AI.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"X Space 10-27-24","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/eliza/community/Streams/10-2024/2024-10-27/","content":"X Space 10-27-24 Space: https://x.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1850609680558805422 00:00:00 - Opening Co-hosts: Shaw and JinPurpose: Structured FAQ session about AI16Z and DegenAIFormat: Pre-collected questions followed by audience Q&amp;A 00:06:40 - AI16Z vs DegenAI Relationship Q: What's the difference between AI16Z and DegenAI?

A: Agent response can include text, action, or both. Process actions checks the action name/similes and executes the corresponding handler. Action description is injected into agent context to guide usage.  00:22:27 - Action execution flow  Check if action should be taken (validation)Determine action outcomeCompose context and send follow-up if continuingExecute desired functionality (mint token, generate image, etc.)Use callback to send messages back to the connector (Discord, Twitter, etc.)  00:24:47 - Choosing actions Q: How does it choose which action to run?

A: Most memory systems are user-agent based, with no room concept. Eliza uses a room abstraction (like a Discord channel/server or Twitter thread) to enable multi-agent simulation. Memories are stored per-agent to avoid collisions.  00:02:57 - Using memories in Eliza  Memories are used in the composeState functionPulls memories from various sources (recent messages, facts, goals, etc.) into a large state objectState object is used to hydrate templatesCustom memory providers can be added to pull from other sources (Obsidian, databases)  00:05:11 - Evaluators vs. Action validation  Actions have a validate function to check if the action is valid to run (e.g., check if agent has a wallet before a swap)Evaluators are a separate abstraction that run a &quot;reflection&quot; stepExample: Fact extraction evaluator runs every N messages to store facts about the user as memoriesAllows agent to &quot;get to know&quot; the user without needing full conversation history  00:07:58 - Example use case: Order book evaluator  Evaluator looks at chats sent to an agent and extracts information about &quot;shields&quot; (tokens?)Uses this to build an order book and &quot;marketplace of trust&quot;  00:09:15 - Mapping Eliza abstractions to OODA loop  Providers: Observe/Orient stages (merged since agent is a data machine)Actions &amp; response handling: Decide stageAction execution: Act stageEvaluators: Update state, then loop back to Decide  00:10:03 - Wrap up  Shaw considers making a video to explain these concepts in depth  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Part 3​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Discord Dev Stream 11-6-24","url":"/eliza/community/Streams/11-2024/2024-11-06/#part-3","content":" Watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FiKJPyaMJI  00:00:00 - Managing large context sizes  State object can get very large, especially with long user postsEliza uses &quot;trim tokens&quot; and a maximum content length (120k tokens) to cap context size New models have 128k-200k context, which is a lot (equivalent to 10 YouTube videos + full conversation) Conversation length is typically capped at 32 messages Fact extraction allows recalling information beyond this windowPer-channel conversation access Increasing conversation length risks more aggressive token trimming from the top of the prompt Keep instructions at the bottom to avoid trimming them  00:01:53 - Billing costs for cloud/GPT models Q: What billing costs have you experienced with cloud/GPT model integration?

I don't know about anybody else.&quot; (0:30:03-0:30:05) Shaw boldly declares OpenAI's models, like ChatGPT, to be completely unusable, especially for character development, claiming they are too &quot;cringe.&quot; This directly contradicts the popular opinion that OpenAI is leading the pack in language model innovation. &quot;Unless you want to have a soul-sucking job, you're never ever going to see Java. You're pretty much going to use Python and JavaScript and stuff like that, or Rust or something.&quot; (0:24:43-0:24:51) Shaw dismisses Java as a relevant programming language for aspiring developers, arguing that it primarily leads to undesirable jobs. This statement is bound to stir debate among Java enthusiasts and those who believe it remains a vital language in many industries. &quot;I really recommend like Grok's great. Anthropic, which is Claude, is great...Llama's great. All these options are good and basically lets you run, you know, whatever. I think Gemini kind of sucks.&quot; (1:32:50-1:33:02) Shaw unapologetically ranks various language models, favoring Grok, Claude, and Llama, while expressing a clear dislike for Google's Gemini. This candid assessment challenges the perceived dominance of Google in the AI landscape and provides a stark contrast to their heavily marketed Gemini model. &quot;I don't really like tools...I don't think the general agent is really good at like stringing together things to do...The action is more like it makes sure that the entire action happens.&quot; (3:00:25 - 3:00:35) Shaw expresses a preference for Eliza's &quot;actions&quot; over the &quot;tool&quot; approach used by other agent frameworks like LangChain. He argues that agents struggle with using tools effectively and that actions provide a more robust and streamlined way to execute tasks. This critique of the widely adopted tool-based approach is likely to generate discussion about the optimal methods for agent task execution. &quot;I find it [GPT-4] unusable, unusable, literally the worst possible model. Like TV three was better.&quot; (3:10:05-3:10:08) Shaw doubles down on his harsh criticism of OpenAI, this time targeting GPT-4 specifically and claiming that its predecessor, GPT-3, was superior. This strong statement flies in the face of the general excitement surrounding GPT-4's advanced capabilities and is sure to provoke reactions from those who believe it represents a significant leap forward in language models.

Episode 1: World Builders","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/eliza/community/Streams/11-2024/2024-11-28/","content":"What Do Machines Dream Of? Episode 1: World Builders Link: https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1vOxwrZYbygJB The speakers were Shaw from ai16z, Arman from OpenServe AI, Nick from a project called Chaos and Disorder or Divine Diarrhea, and the host, fakeguru. Overview: The speakers discussed how AI agents will impact the future, including potential benefits (freeing humans from monotonous jobs, fostering creativity) and challenges (surveillance, corruption). They explored the need to make AI development open and collaborative while considering ethics. The goal is building a future where humans and AI work together for the betterment of society. Key Topics and Timestamps: Intro and speaker introductions (0:00 - 29:47)Chaotic vs ordered mindsets (29:47 - 35:47)Community income and solving automation crisis (42:13 - 58:08)Removing inability to pursue passions (1:22:47 - 1:29:39)Living in an abundance mindset vs scarcity (1:29:39 - 1:35:15)Importance of open collaboration and transparency, including in government (1:35:15 - 1:45:44)Educating people on AI development (1:45:44 - 1:55:03)Impact of AI on privacy and surveillance (1:55:03 - 2:02:22)Balancing benefits and challenges of AI for a better future (2:11:22 - 2:27:08)What item would you take in an apocalypse scenario? (2:27:08 - 2:33:22) Here are some notable topics related to ai16z that were discussed by Shaw in the broadcast: Autonomous Investor and Community Income (42:13 - 58:08): ai16z is close to finishing an autonomous investor AI called &quot;AI Mark&quot; that trades meme coins so it can invest in projects. This ties into building a launch pad for agents.Rather than AI taking jobs, ai16z believes in the concept of &quot;community income.&quot; People could join an investment community (friends, family, online groups) and be part of a community investment model where they receive money and have enough.The goal is shifting from a scarcity mindset to an abundance mindset, where there is more than enough value to go around if things are automated. Money would flow to the right places and people.In the future, putting the &quot;A&quot; (automation) in DAOs could help allocate resources and make policies in a more algorithmic way. AI could make governments more efficient and transparent. Open Collaboration and Transparency (1:35:15 - 1:45:44): ai16z has focused on being radically open. In just 34 days, they had over 100 open-source contributors.Explosive growth came from enabling others to build with their agent framework. Now they are shipping everything they promised.There is a corporate and decentralized groundswell of support for pro-AI policies. While governments may try to protect the status quo, change is happening quickly.AI will likely &quot;eat the government&quot; and make it more efficient by automating things like resource allocation and information collection for policymaking. Special interests currently have outsized influence. Privacy and Surveillance (1:55:03 - 2:02:22): While powerful AI brings risks of government surveillance and overreach, many people are already willingly giving up privacy and putting their information out there openly.People may have to trade some secrecy for the openness and trust to build things together as a society. Emotional openness helps people be themselves.Many are tired of corporate jobs and accounts, so they share data openly. The government will automate surveillance, but people are clicking &quot;accept&quot; on privacy policies.The &quot;panopticon&quot; of surveillance already exists in many ways. People know a lot about public figures like Shaw. But this transparency should extend to the government too. The overarching theme was the importance of open, collaborative AI development with transparency from institutions. ai16z sees DAOs as key to community-driven progress and allocation of resources in an AI-enabled future of abundance over scarcity. While challenges around privacy exist, Shaw believes openness will win out.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"What Did You Get Done This Week 3","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/eliza/community/Streams/11-2024/2024-11-29/","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Timestamps​","type":1,"pageTitle":"What Did You Get Done This Week 3","url":"/eliza/community/Streams/11-2024/2024-11-29/#timestamps","content":" 00:03:40 - Meeting Start &amp; Guidelines00:03:56 - Jin's Update: Automated Discord Summarization &amp; Airdrops (Llama, LangChain)00:08:24 - Choosing Participants (Lots of developer updates follow)00:09:43 - Stargarden: AI for DAO Management &amp; Lore-Keeping00:10:46 - Boya: Duplicate Message Bug, Gamifying Stats, Intent Analysis00:21:24 - Reality Spiral: Coinbase Integrations, GitHub Adapter, Code Coverage, Base Launch00:27:58 - W3Tester: FlyDumpMoney - AI Payments Without Wallet Addresses00:31:03 - HashWarlock: TEE Plugin for Secure Wallet Generation00:33:18 - Soto: Bosso with Multiple Personalities &amp; Animation00:35:21 - Mitch: Dark Sun - AI Investigates Binary Solar System00:36:57 - Nick Parallel: 3D Environments, Robotic Arms, 3D Agent Models00:42:41 - Beige: BlockRat - AI Agent Live Streams Minecraft &amp; Answers Questions00:44:45 - Robin: Apollo - AI Agent for Health &amp; Wellbeing (with User Data)00:47:47 - Eve: Data Set Grader, AI16z Integration, Multi-Agent Systems00:51:14 - Oguz: Eliza Interface, Modularization, Compatibility with Non-Crypto00:55:40 - Swarm: AI Agent Hosting Platform, Real-Time Voice01:01:29 - RektDin: Rogue Agent - Joe Rogan-Inspired Podcast AI with Multiple Characters01:04:08 - Roperito: &quot;Life Engine&quot; for Realistic AI Actions, Deployed &quot;God&quot; AI01:07:56 - Lothbrok: AI for Logistics (Real-Time Data for Shipping &amp; Pricing)01:13:29 - Clark Riswold: Positivity &amp; Humor AI Agent, Experimenting with Personalities01:15:00 - Tim: Eliza's World Update, Scriptoshi - Eliza on Bitcoin, AI-Mediated Token Launch01:25:15 - Spaceodili: Onboarding, IRC Connector, Bug Fixes, Developer Relations01:28:37 - Hawkeye: AI for Marble Auctions (Listing, ID, Bringing Collectibles to Games)01:36:45 - EA: Question about Eliza in Robots01:38:59 - FilteredThought: Improved Twitter Integration (Template-Based)01:41:07 - Yikes: Web3 Research, Liquidity Pools, Internal Eliza01:47:50 - Alain: Multi-Agent System for Code Creation, Debugging, and Improvement (GitHub)01:49:11 - Glue: Quantum Randomness for Ducky's Personality01:52:45 - Maximilian: Dark Sun Launch, Caution about Scale01:53:55 - Danny: Agent Rogue Show Marketing, Invite for Shaw01:55:46 - Shaw's Closing Thoughts: Developer Needs, Upcoming Milestones01:59:40 - YoungJazzeth: Enthusiasm, &quot;Crash Out Coded&quot; Project02:01:50 - Sergio: Greetings, Importance of AI for Good  Overall, the meeting showcases the vibrant open-source AI agent development scene, with developers working on diverse projects across multiple platforms and tackling a variety of use cases.

Actions are defined as capabilities that agents can execute, ranging from simple tasks to complex workflows. Providers serve as information sources for agents, similar to context providers in React. Evaluators run after actions, enabling agents to reflect on their state and decisions.  The live coding portion demonstrates creating a &quot;DevSchool&quot; plugin from scratch, starting with a simple &quot;Hello World&quot; action and progressing to a more complex &quot;Current News&quot; action that fetches and formats news articles. Shaw shows how to extract data from conversations using prompts, making actions dynamic.  The session covers memory management, explaining how agents store and recall information through different types of memory:  Knowledge: Information retrievable through searchLore: Random facts that add variety to responsesConversation history: Recent interactions and context  Shaw emphasizes the importance of prompt engineering, demonstrating how the structure and order of information significantly impacts agent responses. He shows how to view agent context through console logs to understand model inputs and improve agent behavior.  The session concludes with discussions about knowledge management, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and future developments in AI agent capabilities, including the possibility of dynamically generating character files.

Like, very basic capability, like a haystack test out of them. ... I'm against killing the capability and making models way worse than they are for someone's political agenda. I just don't think that's the world we want to live in.&quot;  Shaw here expresses frustration with OpenAI's approach to alignment, arguing that RLHF has diminished the capabilities of their models and that this is due to a &quot;woke&quot; agenda. This take is controversial because it attributes technical limitations to political motivations and ignores the complexities of aligning powerful AI systems.  OpenAI models shouldn't be &quot;telling&quot; developers what they can and can't do (02:03:29-02:03:50)  &quot;OpenAI, if you're listening, please fucking stop telling me how to run models. You don't know as well as I do. I do this every day. You're a fucking engineer who has to go train, like, an LLM. I actually have to use the LLM.&quot;  This rant criticizes OpenAI's models for &quot;telling&quot; developers what they can and can't do, arguing that the models are not as knowledgeable as the developers who are actually using them. This take could be seen as dismissive of the role of AI systems in providing helpful feedback and limitations.  Prompt engineering is the &quot;most easy improvement&quot; for AI agents (02:06:09-02:06:27)  &quot;Huge amount of research would go into that... That's where we'll see like the most easy improvement in our agents.&quot;  Shaw argues that prompt engineering holds the key to significant improvements in AI agents, stating that it's the &quot;most easy improvement.&quot; This take is controversial because it downplays the importance of other areas like model architecture, training data, and algorithm development.  Character files could be generated at runtime, making existing character files obsolete (02:22:05-02:22:53)  &quot;The entire character file could be generated at runtime... The agent's like, I have no idea who I am. And you're like, oh, your name is Eliza, and you like berries. OK, cool. I guess I like berries.&quot;  This take suggests that character files could be generated at runtime, rendering current character files obsolete. This idea is controversial because it could lead to a more dynamic and unpredictable agent behavior, which could raise concerns about control and reliability.  A &quot;badge&quot; system will reward developers who create custom actions, evaluators, and providers (02:24:45-02:25:49)  &quot;If you want that badge, what I'd like you to do is come to the AI Agent Dev School, make an action, have your agent do something. Those are the kinds of people that I really think we'll want to, you know, keep in our ecosystem and keep busy.&quot;  This take suggests a &quot;badge&quot; system to recognize developers who go beyond the basics and create custom components for AI agents. This could be seen as elitist or exclusionary, potentially creating a hierarchy within the AI agent development community.

Key takeaways:  Updating Eliza: Shaw emphasizes staying up-to-date with the rapidly evolving Eliza project due to frequent bug fixes and new features. He provides instructions on pulling the latest changes from the main branch on GitHub.Focus on Providers and Evaluators: The stream focuses on building a practical provider-evaluator loop to demonstrate a popular use case for AI agents – filling out a form by extracting user information.Form Builder Example: Shaw walks the audience through building a &quot;form provider&quot; that gathers a user's name, location, and job. This provider utilizes a cache to store already extracted information and instructs the agent to prompt the user for any missing details.Evaluator Role: The evaluator continually checks the cache for the completeness of user data. Once all information is extracted, the evaluator triggers an action to send the collected data to an external API (simulated in the example).Live Coding and AI Assistance: Shaw live codes the example, using tools like &quot;Code2Prompt&quot; and Claude AI to help generate and refine the code. He advocates for writing code in a human-readable manner, utilizing comments to provide context and guidance for both developers and AI assistants.Agentic Applications: Shaw highlights the potential of agentic applications to replicate existing website functionality through conversational interfaces, bringing services directly to users within their preferred social media platforms.Community Engagement: Shaw encourages active participation from the community, suggesting contributions to the project through pull requests and feedback on desired features and patterns for future Dev School sessions.  Overall, this live stream provided a practical tutorial on building a common AI agent use case (form filling) while emphasizing the potential of the Eliza framework for developing a wide range of agentic applications.

This contrasts with polished tutorials, highlighting the iterative and messy nature of this new technology. &quot;I'm actually not gonna put this in a plugin. I'm gonna put this in the agent... just so you can see what happens if you were to, like, make your own agent without using a plugin at all.&quot; (00:37:24,793) - Shaw goes against the Eliza framework's plugin structure, showing viewers how to bypass it entirely. This bold move emphasizes flexibility, but could spark debate on best practices and potential drawbacks. &quot;I really don't remember conversations from people very well, like verbatim, but I definitely remember like the gist, the context, the really needy ideas.&quot; (00:24:48,180) - Shaw draws a controversial parallel between human memory and the Eliza agent's fact extraction. Reducing human interaction to &quot;needy ideas&quot; is provocative, questioning the depth of social understanding AI agents currently possess. &quot;It's just an LLM. It's just making those numbers up. It could be off. I don't really buy the confidence here.&quot; (01:13:56,971) - Shaw dismisses the confidence scores generated by the Large Language Model (LLM), revealing a distrust of these black-box outputs. This skepticism is crucial in a field where relying solely on AI's self-assessment can be misleading. &quot;Dude, that's a $250 million market cap token. Let's get that shit in Bubba Cat.&quot; (01:45:34,809) - Shaw throws out a blunt, market-driven statement regarding the AIXBT token. Bringing finance directly into the technical discussion highlights the intertwined nature of AI development and potential financial incentives, a topic often tiptoed around.

This helps the agent maintain conversational context and avoid repetitive responses within short-term exchanges. Factual Memory: Holds specific, context-based facts about the user or environment, such as user preferences, recent activities, or specific details mentioned in previous interactions. This type of memory enables the agent to recall user-specific information across sessions. Knowledge Base: Contains general knowledge the agent might need to respond to broader queries or provide informative answers. This memory is more static, helping the agent retrieve pre-defined data, common responses, or static character lore. Relationship Tracking: Manages the agent’s understanding of its relationship with users, including details like user-agent interaction frequency, sentiment, and connection history. It is particularly useful for building rapport and providing a more personalized interaction experience over time. RAG Integration: Uses a vector search to perform contextual recall based on similarity matching. This enables the agent to retrieve relevant memory snippets or knowledge based on the content and intent of the current conversation, making its responses more contextually relevant.
