They explored ideas such as using multiple agents to analyze code repositories for building client applications across social platforms, acknowledging the limitations of current LLM-based agent technology but recognizing its utility when functional. Metapontum shared his work on creating desktops and VMs with MITM proxies that automatically inject API keys into HTTP requests, enhancing parallel development approaches. Shaw suggested scraping API keys from GitHub as a manual alternative to metapontum's automated method. They discussed the potential of using NFS for shared VM storage and considered the challenges of rapid agent prototyping versus traditional methods like cloning Git repositories. The conversation also touched on the importance of infrastructure, such as live-migration technology, in facilitating efficient development processes.
