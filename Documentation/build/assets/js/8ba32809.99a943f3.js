The conversation highlighted challenges in fitting the model within memory constraints and explored different positional encoding strategies, including one-hot and quadtree encodings. Shaw considered switching from a one-hot strategy due to its high dimensionality and was evaluating a quadtree approach that seemed promising after merging into their project repository. The team also discussed the potential of using a schedule-free optimizer which showed positive results, bringing down the loss further to 1.5. Shaw expressed interest in developing a refinement network next but faced limitations due to training on a single GPU and was considering whether tinyllama framework could be beneficial despite its small size.
