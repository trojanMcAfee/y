The team considered augmenting training sets with varying difficulty levels of sequence generation, including noisy sinusoidal patterns. Sidbin and Yikesawjeez joined the server, welcomed by Shaw. A significant technical decision was made when Shaw merged start and end tokens for better model convergence, which led to a loss below 1 after removing label smoothing from the CrossEntropyLoss function. The team also recognized an oversight in treating input pairs as separate entities rather than grouped based on relationships, with AutoMeta suggesting a perception-based approach using one token at a time and Arch2230 proposing to reformulate their problem-solving strategy by learning mathematical relationships between candidate solutions. Shaw proposed the idea of generating convolutional kernels dynamically within a CNN framework but acknowledged the gap between feasibility and completion, mentioning an update with position encoding in the dataset.
